/* The following will showcase how to group descendant combinators.

Notice that the type selectors div and p are separated by a space.

If they were separated by a comma then every single div and p element in the associated HTML file would have the attributes below applied to them.  We DO NOT WANT THIS in this example.

What we want is for only the p elements nested (child) inside the div element (parent) to have the attributes below. Any  p element that is NOT nested (not a descendant) within a div element WILL NOT have the attributes below.  This is what we want!

div p{
    background-color: yellow;
    color: red;
    font-size: 20px;
    text-align: center;
    }

 
/* Below are some other possible descendant combinators:
div p
div .text
.container p
