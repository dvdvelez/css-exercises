/*The following is to further expand on different class combinations.

Notice that in line 16 the first and second class selectors are separated by a comma.
This is a very important distinction between using a comma and using a blank space to separate both selectors.
Using a blank space would make it possible to apply descendant combinators as you will see in css exercise 05-descendant-combinators.*/
