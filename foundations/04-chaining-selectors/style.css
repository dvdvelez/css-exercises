/* The following showcases the chaining of selectors with unique and shared attributes.

Notice, the class selectors avatar, proportioned, and distorted are NOT separated by a comma or a blank space.

This means that elements in an HTML file must have either both avatar AND proportioned or avatar AND distorted classes to have either of the attributes below.
